        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>- Bidaa Bint Saud was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.<br>
          - Numerous stone-constructed tombs were discovered and excavated on top of the mountain called Gharn bint Saud to the north of Al Ain. The largest of these tombs is rectangular in shape, measuring 8 metres in length and 6 metres in width.<br>
          - The site, located some 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) north of Al Ain, is thought to have been a stopping place on a long-established caravan route from settlements at Al Ain to the Northern Emirates. The rocky outcrop of Garn bin Saud looms some 40 m (130 ft) above the site and is dotted with burial remains.<br>
          - The site has 5 stars on Google and according to a local 
          guide it is apparently good for ski watching??</p></div>
